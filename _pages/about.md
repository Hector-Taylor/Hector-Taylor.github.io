Hello! I'm Hector. Thanks for stopping by. 

I'm currently employed as the Lab Manager of The Virtual Environment Navigation lab at Brown University. Before that, I had a number of affiliations at Arizona State University, in the Perception, Ecological Action, Robotics, and Learning Lab (PI: Dr. Michael McBeath), the Embodied Games Lab (PI: Dr. Mina Johnson Glenberg), and the METEOR Studio (PI: Dr. Robert LiKamWa). 

This site will function as a hybrid sort of blog/portfolio/scholarly resource. Go ahead and check out the submenus at the top to take a closer look!

To characterize my interests very broadly: I aim to advance a scholarship of digitally embodied cognition and improve our understanding of humans as spatially embedded actors in information space. A mouthful, I know. 

I also think that, intuitively, we should use computers in 3 dimensions. This is a future that I think we should all be excited for.
